# Resident, showing all registers in MS DOS
## To get started:
  Compile ``TSR6.ASM`` (last version of the programm) in folder with other files. Then to upload resident run compiled file ``TSR6.COM``. When resident is already uploaded press ``<LShift>`` to see registers, type ``<RShift>`` to hide them. There is an indicator in top left corner that shows a status ("ON"/"OFF") of the program.
